          <section class="content"><p>For a while I’ve been working on a project in <a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/">V8</a> to encode type feedback into
simple data structures rather than embedding it in compiled&nbsp;code.</p>
<hr>
<p>The V8 inline
cache system typically compiles a “dispatcher” which checks an incoming object
map against a constant. If there is a match, control is dispatched to a handler,
which may be a stock stub or be specially compiled for this object. The inline
cache (<span class="caps">IC</span>) patches this dispatcher code into a compiled function. The dispatcher
improves performance, because many decisions have been reduced to a comparison
of a map against a constant (we call this a map check). We can also examine
the dispatcher later for it’s embedded maps to determine what it knows when
creating optimized&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>After this thumbnail sketch of how ICs work (here is <a href="http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/06/03/explaining-js-vms-in-js-inline-caches.html">a much better one</a>), you may think, why change it? Well,
it would be nice to avoid patching code for security reasons and the fact that
it causes a flush of the instruction cache which hampers performance on some
platforms. Storing our maps in arrays is natural and makes extending the
information we collect easier. For example, we might want to store polymorphic
call counts. When we use a data structure, we can just store a triple for each
map: the map, the “handler” that we jump to, and finally an integer
count. That could be used later to order polymorphic calls. You might even
coalesce this data by shunting rarely used maps to a generic handler and
therefore reduce the degree of&nbsp;polymorphism.</p>
<p>So that’s why it would be nice to embed information in data structures rather
than code. But the V8 <span class="caps">IC</span> system is rich, complex and performance
sensitive. Becuase of that introducing data structures for feedback has been
slow. A year ago I began using the “type feedback vector” to record data for
calls from one JavaScript function to another. Now I’m working on making loads
(like <code>x = obj.foo</code> and keyed loads like <code>x = obj[h]</code> use the type
feedback vector, and avoid patching code&nbsp;completely.</p>
<p>It’s difficult because a data structure solution means more memory loads no
matter how you slice it. Here we come to another potential beneft of a type
vector: it could be used in optimized code for which we only have partial type
feedback. Normally, V8 will deoptimize an optimized function if it begins
running a section for which we never ran before in full code. This could happen
if the function is considered “hot” but there is a branch that was never yet
taken. With the type feedback vector, we could install vector-based ICs in those
information-poor locations, allow them to learn for a while, then reoptimize
after achieving a certain threshold of new&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Deoptimizing functions is expensive for V8, and I’ll go into that more later -
it’s just a tremendous amount of work and complexity. Type vectors offer the
possibility to smooth out and moderate the optimized/un-optimized transition
curve over the lifetime of an&nbsp;application.</p>
<p>So that is my motivation. V8 is using the type vector for call ICs as mentioned,
but loads are the important case because there are so many of them. If that can
be achieved, then we have license to go the rest of the way and eliminate
patching entirely. It’s a tremendously fun&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>I’ve been writing this document as I learned about the area, and was inspired by 
<a href="http://mrale.ph/blog/2012/06/03/explaining-js-vms-in-js-inline-caches.html">Vyacheslav Egorov’s article explaining inline
caches</a>
in a readable and entertaining way. I loved the way his drawings looked, as it
reminded me of the only way I seem to be able to internalize most concepts: by
drawing them on paper. Vyacheslav built <a href="https://moe-js.googlecode.com/git/talks/jsconfeu2012/tools/shaky/deploy/shaky.html">a
tool</a>
to create attractive “box and pointer” drawings from <span class="caps">ASCII</span>, and I
started using it to think about the process along the way. Creating these
pictures because a major part of the fun in the last few days&nbsp;:D.</p>
<h2 id="too-many-loads">Too many&nbsp;loads</h2>
<p>I’ve already spent time micro-optimizing my data-driven dispatcher, which
grovels about in the vector to complete it’s map-checks and dispatches. That is
the subject of another article, but suffice to say here that when I’m
contemplating doing 2 levels of speculative reads into data carefully
constructed to guarantee crash avoidance, just in order to save one additional
read…I’ve probably hit the end of the line for that&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p>Now I turn to the number of reads required before the call to the
dispatcher. The type vector is an array attached to the SharedFunctionInfo for a
JavaScript function. It’s indexed by a “slot,” and these slots are handed out
at compilation time to compilation nodes that request them. The <span class="caps">IC</span> receives a pointer to the
vector and an integer index into the vector (the index is derived from the slot
but not the same&nbsp;thing).</p>
<p>Fair enough, but how do we load the vector into a register for the call? I could
just embed it in the code, as it’s a constant, but experimentally, this changed
the code size so much even just when using it for calls, that it would bloat the
code unacceptably if I do this for all <span class="caps">IC</span> types. It threw off our profiler
calculations, highlighting a weakness there that the profiler is based on code
size in bytes rather than say, number of abstract syntax tree nodes (this should be tackled and
solved, of course!). What proved a better solution for production was a series
of loads. The <code>JSFunction</code> associated with this function is available in the
stack frame. I load that, then walk through to the vector hanging off the
SharedFunctionInfo. It seems that these loads aren’t too expensive because the
data is in the&nbsp;cache.</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-jsfunction.png" width=600></center>

<p>But for wider deployment of the type vector concept, this many loads becomes
hard to support. Consider function <strong>foo</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">foo</span><span class="params">(obj, x)</span> {</span>
  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; x.length; i++) {
    x[i] = x[i] * i + obj.foo;
    check(i);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The expressions <code>x.length</code>, the second <code>x[i]</code>, <code>obj.foo</code>, and
  <code>check(i)</code> all need the type vector. Just considering that the vector needs 3
loads, that is <code>3 * 4 * x.length</code> loads.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would just have 3 loads, by hoisting the vector load out of the
loop. But that involves more architecture than we want to invest in full
code. Usage of the type vector in optimized code isn’t supposed to be very
heavy, but by introducing the vector as a node in those compilations we’ll get
that kind of hoisting there. But I can reduce the number of loads by storing the
feedback vector in the frame, meaning we’ll have <code>4 * x.length</code> loads (or at
least until the profiler decides the function is hot enough and drops in an
optimized version in place via on-stack-replacement (<span class="caps">OSR</span>), which is a fantastic
thing). 
Whats more, these loads are all from a stack address in the frame and should remain in
the&nbsp;cache. </p>
<p>This means I’ll have to alter the frame layout.&nbsp;Gulp.</p>
<h2 id="unoptimized-javascript-frames-get-a-vector">Unoptimized JavaScript frames get a&nbsp;Vector</h2>
<p>First off, why only add the vector to unoptimized JavaScript frames? Well, an
optimized JavaScript frame actually contains many vectors, one for each function
that it inlines. The vector for the ostensibly optimized function is only
partially useful, and couldn’t be referred to by any of the inlined
functions. Of course, there could be a load/restore step surrounding inlined
calls, but that seems like a lot of work in code that should be tight, and
ideally, shouldn’t use the type vector at all. Ideally we’ve learned from all
ICs seen thus far. Also, if we need to refer to a type feedback vector in
optimized code, we could let sophisticated technologies like <span class="caps">GVN</span> and the
register allocator decide where to put the constant vector address and when to
load&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Therefore, here is a V8 JavaScript Frame, with a type vector field added just
after the JSFunction. The stack is positioned just before making a call to
another&nbsp;function:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame1.png" width=600></center>

<p>An optimized frame looks a bit different. There is no vector, but there is an
alignment word on 32 bit platforms that indicates whether the stack has been
aligned or not. Here is a case where no alignment occurred, and just before a
call to another&nbsp;function:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame2.png" width=600></center>

<p>Alignment introduces some complication. When we are about to save the previous
<code>$ebp</code> to the stack, we check to see if <code>$esp</code> is aligned. If so, we proceed
normally, saving the value 0 in the alignment slot in the frame. Otherwise,
we’ll move the receiver, arguments and return address down one word on the
stack, putting a “zap value” (<code>0x12345678</code>) where the receiver used to be. Then in the
alignment slot we’ll store the value 2 as a signal when it’s time to dismantle
the frame. When we encounter that value on return, we know we need to clear one
more word from the stack on return (the “zap value”). We have to read the
alignment slot before we dismantle the frame, then after taking the frame down
we have to take care of the receiver and arguments. The example below is a
function with one argument, and a receiver. The
optimized frame just has one real spill slot, the other is reserved for the
alignment&nbsp;word.</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-align.png" width=600></center>

<p>The need for alignment of an optimized frame is recognized on entry, before
setting up the frame. A “zap value” is inserted and the stack values get moved
down one word. In step (3), the optimized frame has been built, and the
alignment word contains the value 2 as a hint that the zap value also needs to
be popped from the stack on&nbsp;return.</p>
<h2 id="deoptimization">Deoptimization</h2>
<p>If an optimized function needs to deoptimize, then it’s frame needs to be
translated into several output frames, since a single optimized function may
contain many inlined functions as well. We end up with one <code>InputFrame</code> and
several <code>OutputFrames</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s take an optimized function with no arguments that deopts on entry. The
function has two spill slots, one for the alignment word. The deopt process is
begun with a call to a function that pushes a Bailout <span class="caps">ID</span>. The
deoptimization function then pushes registers to the stack and prepares to
create a <code>Deoptimizer</code> object.</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-deopt.png" width=600></center>

<p>The function has deopted, and is preparing to create the Deoptimizer object. All
of the necessary information is on the stack. This information is used to build the Deoptimizer. We then unwind the whole
stack, copying all the registers and then the frame to the input
<code>FrameDescription</code> object allocated when the Deoptimizer was created. At this
point we go to C++ and compute all of the output frames. After this, 
we check the alignment word, and pop off the alignment “zap
value” if it’s present (not in the example above). We end up at a completely
empty stack, with no way to do anything or go anywhere, because we’ve even
popped off the return&nbsp;address.</p>
<p>We loop over all the output frames, pushing their contents to the stack from the
higher (deepest) addresses to the lower (most shallow)&nbsp;addresses:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-deopt2.png" width=600></center>

<p>The OutputFrames have been computed, and are being copied to the stack in the
appropriate place. Finally, continuation data and register state are propped to
the stack. We’ll pop the registers into place, return to the continuation
address, and finally state and pc are consumed to deposit us rather prettily
into frame&nbsp;N-1.</p>
<p>With a <code>popad</code> instruction, we
restore the saved registers to the <span class="caps">CPU</span>, then
execute a <code>ret</code> instruction to pop the continuation address from the stack
and jump to it’s code. The state and pc addresses will be consumed to
appropriately enter unoptimized code at the right point with the right
registers. The stack will gradually unwind&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<p>The output frames have a different fixed size thanks to the addition of the type
feedback vector in full-code JavaScript frames. Here is a side-by-side
translation of the bottom-most frame in a one argument, non-aligned example
where the output frame has no&nbsp;locals:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-deopt3.png" width=600></center>

<p>Alternatively, if the bottom-most optimized frame was aligned, we’d have to
remove the alignment zap value and shift values to higher stack addresses
(forgive me for focusing so much on alignment…it was rather a&nbsp;bear):</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-deopt4.png" width=600></center>

<p>An aligned, optimized InputFrame gets replaced on the stack like so. Note that
the output frame is the same as that in the previous unaligned&nbsp;case.</p>
<h2 id="on-stack-replacement-osr-">On Stack Replacement&nbsp;(<span class="caps">OSR</span>)</h2>
<p>If we run a tight loop, we may want to optimize and replace code before we
finish. This means optimizing and installing our optimized frame over the
current frame. In fact, we think of simply appending the new parts of our new
frame to the end of the existing JavaScriptFrame. Optimized frames have spill
slots. These will go right after the locals of the frame already there. The
first job on entry to the optimized code (mid-loop, how exciting!) is to copy
those locals into spill slots where the register allocator can track&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I altered the <span class="caps">OSR</span> entry point to shift those locals up one word on the stack,
overwriting the vector slot from the unoptimized frame. My first approach, which
ended in a hail of mysterious test failures was to leave the vector in place,
and try to get the optimizing compiler to treat it as an “extra” spill
slot. This became very complicated. For one thing, the deoptimizer had to figure
out if it was deoptimizing a function with OSR entries or not, and do the right
thing with the “extra” word in the former case. Also, Crankshaft optimized functions with an OSR
entry can later be entered from the start, and this starting prologue would have
to push an extra dummy value in order to remain in sync with the offsets to
locals and spill slots
established at the OSR entry point. Life was way better when I abandoned this&nbsp;approach!</p>
<p>Consider also that optimized frames want to be aligned, so the replacement of
code to use <span class="caps">OSR</span> also means moving the existing parts of the frame. Here is an
example, showing the unoptimized stack on the left, and the optimized one on the
right. In the before/after diagram, note that the fixed
part gets smaller with the removal of the vector in the optimized&nbsp;frame:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-osr.png" width=600></center>

<h2 id="virtual-deoptimization-for-the-debugger">Virtual deoptimization for the&nbsp;debugger</h2>
<p>We have a test <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/master/test/mjsunit/debug-evaluate-locals-optimized.js"><strong>debug-evaluate-locals-optimized.js</strong></a> which verifies that the
debugger can interpret locals and arguments of all functions on the stack, even
if some of the functions are optimized. The example sets up a series of calls
from function <code>f</code> down to function <code>h</code> and invokes the debugger in
function <code>h</code> to verify expected&nbsp;values.</p>
<pre><code>Function  Locals           Notes
f         a4 = 9, b4 = 10  call g1 (inlined in f, argument adapted)
g1        a3 = 7, b3 = 8   call g2 (inlined in f, constructor frame and
                                    argument adapted)
g2        a2 = 5, b2 = 6   call g3 (inlined in f)
g3        a1 = 3, b1 = 4   call h (not inlined)
h         a0 = 1, b0 = 2   breakpoint
</code></pre><p>The deoptimization infrastructure is used by the debugger to compute and store
these local values in a data structure for later perusal. We “deoptimize”
function <code>f</code> without actually doing so, but only to harvest the output
frames created in a buffer from that process. <code>f</code> decomposes into 7 output
frames. Here is the input frame layed out on the stack from the call 
<code>f(4, 11, 12)</code>, and on the right is the bottommost output frame representing
the unoptimized function <code>f</code>:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/debug-example-f.png" width=600></center>

<p>The locals and parameters for the full code frame of <code>f</code> can be queried
according to known frame&nbsp;layouts.</p>
<p>Note the literal <code>g1</code>, which is on the stack, not part of the locals, but simply
an expression saved before the call out to g1. Below are the remaining interesting
OutputFrame data structures, one each for g1, g2 and g3. In the g1 frame, I expected to
see a literal expression for the call to g2 on the stack and was initially
worried about a bug. However g2 is called with <code>new g2(...)</code>, and constructor calls
don’t push an expression onto the stack before the&nbsp;call.</p>
<center><img src="drawings/debug-example-rest.png" width=700></center>

<p><code>g2</code> is called with 3 arguments, but it only accepts one so an arguments adaptor
frame is inserted (not displayed here). <code>g3</code> is called with three arguments as
expected, so no adaptor frame is inserted. In total, 7 OutputFrames are&nbsp;computed:</p>
<ol>
<li>f</li>
<li>arguments&nbsp;adaptor</li>
<li>g1</li>
<li>constructor&nbsp;frame</li>
<li>arguments&nbsp;adaptor</li>
<li>g2</li>
<li>g3</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we start copying this information into a data structure for debugging. First
we examine the frame for <code>g3</code>.</p>
<p>Although my changes in the deoptimizer resulted in correct OutputFrames, the
interpretation was broken. I had to change the <code>FrameDescription</code> class to
return local offsets correctly according to whether it was describing an
<code>OPTIMIZED</code> frame or a <code>JAVA_SCRIPT</code> frame. This would correctly reflect the
variation I’ve introduced with the type feedback vector. With that change made,
the test passes, finding all of the local variables with their correct&nbsp;values.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, this picture shows I get what I want if the system in is&nbsp;place:</p>
<center><img src="drawings/frame-vector.png" width=600></center>

<p>But how about performance? It looks good for most benchmarks, but there are a
few SunSpider tests that are short enough that we don’t manage to run optimized
code, and there is a net loss because our unmanaged frames are 1 word bigger. I
do have to pay for that. Before making this part of the tree, I’ll need to
validate that the cost is worthwhile when considering the type vector passage as
a whole. On the whole, I’m&nbsp;optimistic.</p>

platforms is <a href="https://codereview.chromium.org/942513002/">here</a>. Thank you for
